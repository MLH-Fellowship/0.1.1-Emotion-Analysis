Teacher's Pet is an open-source web application that allows teachers to do track student engagement during Zoom calls.

Students run the app alongside their Zoom class, collecting information about whether theyâ€™re looking at the screen and their emotions. The teacher can then use this data to measure engagement and general feedback, such as how many kids showed confusion or happiness throughout class.
